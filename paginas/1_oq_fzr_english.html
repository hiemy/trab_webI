                        Located in the municipality of Jijoca de Jericoacoara, the Paradise Lagoon, which is considered one of the best beaches in Brazil - is one of the main attractions in the region. 
                        is one of the main attractions of the region. It is a lagoon with crystal clear waters, with shades of blue and green. Along its extension 
                        are some establishments, among them the Alchymist (photo below), a club that has a great structure and several VIP areas.

                        The establishments on the lagoon place hammocks in the water for visitors to enjoy - this way you can enjoy the lagoon and relax at the same time. 
                        at the same time, a delight! For those who really want to enjoy the lagoon, I recommend spending the whole day there, which depending on your 
                        depending on your taste, can be as good as spending the day at the beach (or even better).

                        Usually people visit the lagoon during the east coast tour, but time is limited. In the village center 
                        you will find transports that take people to spend the day at the lagoon and then return to pick them up.
